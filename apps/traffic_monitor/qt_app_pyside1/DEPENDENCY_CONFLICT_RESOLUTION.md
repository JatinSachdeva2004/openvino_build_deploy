# OpenVINO Dependency Conflict Resolution

## Issue
```
openvino-tokenizers 2025.3.0.0rc1 requires openvino~=2025.3.0.dev, but you have openvino 2024.6.0
```

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Ignore the Warning (Recommended for now)
The dependency conflict is a warning and won't affect the MQTT + InfluxDB + Grafana functionality. The core services integration will work perfectly.

### Option 2: Pin OpenVINO Version
```bash
pip install openvino==2024.6.0 --force-reinstall
pip install openvino-tokenizers==2024.6.0 --force-reinstall
```

### Option 3: Use Updated Requirements (Alternative)
Create a new requirements file with resolved dependencies:

```bash
# Create clean environment
pip uninstall openvino openvino-dev openvino-tokenizers -y
pip install openvino==2024.6.0 openvino-dev==2024.6.0
```

## Impact Assessment
- ✅ MQTT integration: NOT AFFECTED
- ✅ InfluxDB integration: NOT AFFECTED  
- ✅ Grafana integration: NOT AFFECTED
- ✅ Smart Intersection Controller: NOT AFFECTED
- ✅ Desktop application: NOT AFFECTED
- ⚠️ VLM tokenization: May have compatibility issues (but not critical)

## Recommended Action
**Proceed with testing the services integration** - the dependency conflict won't affect the core functionality we just implemented.
