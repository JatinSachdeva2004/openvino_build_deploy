# Smart Intersection Analytics - Desktop Integration

## Overview
This documentation describes the Smart Intersection analytics capabilities integrated into the Traffic Monitoring Desktop Application. The system demonstrates how edge AI technologies can address traffic management challenges using scene-based analytics.

## Key Features Integrated

### Multi-Camera Scene Analytics
- **Multi-camera multi-object tracking**: Enables tracking of objects across multiple camera views
- **Scene based analytics**: Regions of interest that span multiple views can be easily defined
- **Real-time processing**: Object tracks and analytics available in near real-time

### Use Cases
- **Pedestrian Safety**: Enhance safety for vulnerable road users (VRUs) at crosswalks
  - Scene-based region of interest (ROI) analytics help identify VRUs actively using crosswalks
  - Detect unsafe situations, such as pedestrians walking outside designated crosswalk areas
- **Vehicle Analytics**: Measure average vehicle count and average dwell time in each lane
  - Vehicles spending too much time in a lane indicates anomalies such as stalled vehicles, accidents, and congestion

### Desktop Application Benefits
- **Reduced TCO**: Works with existing cameras and simplifies business logic development
- **Local Processing**: All analytics run locally with Intel Arc GPU acceleration
- **Integrated UI**: Scene analytics configuration and monitoring within the main application
- **Real-time Insights**: VLM-powered insights for enhanced understanding of traffic patterns

## Configuration

### Scene Analytics Settings
The application includes configuration options for:
- **Tracker Parameters**: Frame rate handling, measurement thresholds
- **Camera Setup**: Multi-camera calibration and positioning
- **ROI Definition**: Define regions of interest for analytics
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize for Intel Arc GPU acceleration

### Access Through UI
- Navigate to the **Config** tab in the main application
- Select **Smart Intersection** settings
- Configure parameters and apply changes
- View live analytics in the **Analytics** tab

## Technical Integration
The desktop application integrates scene-based analytics through:
- **Scene Adapter**: Python utilities for object detection processing
- **Configuration Management**: JSON-based settings for tracker and scene parameters
- **Signal Processing**: Qt signals for real-time data flow between components
- **GPU Acceleration**: OpenVINO optimized pipelines for Intel Arc GPU

## Getting Started
1. Open the Traffic Monitoring Desktop Application
2. Navigate to **Config** → **Smart Intersection**
3. Configure your camera settings and ROI definitions
4. Apply settings and view analytics in the **Analytics** tab
5. Access detailed insights through the **Help** → **User Guide** menu
