# 🚦 COMPREHENSIVE VIOLATION DETECTION SYSTEM
## Enhanced Event-Driven Processing for Maximum Accuracy & Performance

---

## 🎯 **SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

The enhanced `video_controller_new.py` now implements a **comprehensive, event-driven violation detection system** that addresses all major traffic violations with optimized performance and accuracy.

---

## 🚀 **VIOLATION TYPES IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **🔴 RED LIGHT RUNNING (Enhanced)**
**Event Trigger**: Traffic light turns red + vehicles near violation line
**Detection Logic**:
- ROI restriction to 30px around violation line
- Multi-frame line crossing detection (last 2 frames)
- Enhanced slow creep detection (≥2px over 3 frames)
- 3px tolerance for detection jitter compensation
- Once-per-cycle violation logging to prevent duplicates

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Catches slow-moving/creeping cars
- ✅ Reduces false positives from tracking errors
- ✅ Event-driven processing (only when red + vehicles present)

### 2. **🚶 PEDESTRIAN RIGHT-OF-WAY VIOLATION (New)**
**Event Trigger**: Pedestrians detected + green light + crosswalk area
**Detection Logic**:
- Only activates when pedestrians are actually detected
- Checks for pedestrians inside crosswalk polygon
- Only processes moving vehicles in crosswalk area
- Simple centroid-in-polygon check for efficiency

**Features**:
- ✅ Event-driven: Only runs when pedestrians present
- ✅ Prevents false violations when no pedestrians around
- ✅ Accurate crosswalk overlap detection

### 3. **🛑 IMPROPER CROSSWALK STOPPING (New)**
**Event Trigger**: Red light + stopped vehicles
**Detection Logic**:
- Only checks vehicles that are confirmed stopped
- Uses simple rectangle-based crosswalk polygon
- Prevents checking moving vehicles (irrelevant case)
- Once-per-cycle logging to avoid spam

**Features**:
- ✅ Event-driven: Only runs for stopped vehicles at red
- ✅ Fast polygon intersection math
- ✅ Prevents duplicate violations

### 4. **🟡 YELLOW/AMBER ACCELERATION VIOLATION (New)**
**Event Trigger**: Light turns yellow
**Detection Logic**:
- Captures speed at yellow onset for all vehicles near stop line
- Monitors speed changes for 1+ seconds after yellow starts
- Detects >20% speed increase with minimum speed threshold
- Only checks vehicles within 50px of stop line

**Features**:
- ✅ Two-step speed comparison (onset vs. current)
- ✅ Eliminates jitter with time-based sampling
- ✅ ROI-based processing for performance

## ⚡ **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS**

### **Event-Driven Processing**
```python
# OLD: Check every frame regardless
for vehicle in all_vehicles:
    check_all_violations(vehicle)

# NEW: Check only when relevant
if pedestrians_detected and green_light:
    check_pedestrian_violations()
if red_light and vehicles_near_line:
    check_red_light_violations()
```

### **ROI Restriction**
- **Red Light**: Only vehicles within 30px of violation line
- **Pedestrian**: Only moving vehicles when pedestrians in crosswalk
- **Crosswalk Stop**: Only stopped vehicles at red light
- **Yellow Accel**: Only vehicles within 50px of stop line

### **Unified Temporal Window**
- Single 3-5 frame history buffer for all checks
- Reduced memory footprint vs. multiple buffers
- Consistent temporal analysis across violation types

### **Confidence Gating**
- Skip violation logic if traffic light confidence < 0.7
- Skip tracking if ByteTrack confidence low
- Only process "clean signals" for accuracy

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Helper Methods Added**
```python
def point_in_crosswalk(self, point, crosswalk_poly):
    """Fast rectangle-based polygon check"""
    
def calculate_vehicle_speed(self, track_id):
    """Speed calculation from position history"""
```

### **State Management**
```python
# Per-vehicle violation state tracking
self.vehicle_statuses[track_id] = {
    'violation_logged': False,           # Red light violation
    'pedestrian_violation_logged': False, # Pedestrian right-of-way
    'crosswalk_stop_logged': False,      # Improper crosswalk stopping
    'yellow_accel_logged': False,        # Yellow acceleration
    'yellow_onset_speed': 0.0           # Speed when yellow started
}
```

### **Scene Context Initialization**
```python
# Scene detection (once per scene change)
crosswalk_bbox = detect_crosswalk_bbox(frame, traffic_light_bbox)
violation_line_y = detect_violation_line(frame, traffic_light_bbox)
```

## 🛡️ **ROBUSTNESS FEATURES**

### **Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback when crosswalk/violation line detection fails
- Safe polygon operations with bounds checking
- Exception handling for tracking/speed calculation errors

### **False Positive Reduction**
